## Overview of the Analysis

Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, is looking to improve its funding selection process by using machine learning and neural networks. The dataset provided by Alphabet Soup includes over 34,000 funded organizations. The goal of this project is to predict the success of future applicants. Utilizing features provided in the dataset, including metadata about each organization, a binary classifier will be developed to figure out the likelihood of success if an organization receives funding from Alphabet Soup. These are the futures given in the dataset:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
